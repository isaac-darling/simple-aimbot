# simple-aimbot
An artificial intelligence who plays a simplified version of a common aimtrainer (program for gamers to practice aiming).

## Notes:
(I built this circa November 2021)  
At the time I got a sudden desire to write another NEAT AI, and the simple game I decided to pit against it was faux Kovaak's (fovaaks). The game can be played manually, can be used to train a new model, or can be used to test an existing model that was stored using pickle.
